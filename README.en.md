# 🚀 Spectre Panel

</div>

**Spectre Panel** is a modern, high-performance, and stealth VPN web control panel designed to bypass internet censorship. It integrates the power of **Xray** and **Hysteria 2** cores with a user-friendly web interface, rich visual effects, and extensive automation capabilities.

---

## 📋 Quick Start Guide (One-Click Installation)

To automatically install dependencies, configure cores, and launch the panel, run the following command:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReturnFI/spectre-panel/main/install.sh)
```

> [!NOTE]
> The installation script will automatically install Docker, set up system services, generate secure random passwords/secret path, and output your login credentials card.

## 💎 Features

* **Xray Core**: Support for VLESS (with classical `X25519` and post-quantum `ML-KEM-768` Reality key exchanges), VMess, Trojan, ShadowSocks, SOCKS5 protocols.
* **Hysteria 2 Core**: High-speed QUIC-based protocol supporting Masquerade and Obfuscation (Salamander) modes.
* **Stealth Masking (Decoy)**: Protects your admin panel from scans by showing a decoy page (Nginx 404, landing page, proxying, or redirect) on root requests.
* **Outbound Routing**: Direct PASTE proxy link import from clipboard, real-time TCP ping latency checks, and HTTP transit proxy tests.
* **Quota Management**: Blocks clients automatically upon exceeding traffic limits, subscription expiration, or concurrent IP limits.
